### 1. Review of task: 


“In this assignment you will work in a group (size 2 or 3) to design and implement a Python package of your choice. Students are expected to self-organise and agree the sharing of the workload between themselves. As part of the assignment evidence must be submitted of at least 3 group meetings. Students can assume the package they develop will be used by a fellow health data scientist. You will employ best practice in the package’s design, implementation and deployment. The specific application area of the package can be chosen by the group, but it must be applicable with the general area of health and medicine. The package might for example: • Provide high-level visualisation tools for a certain type or class of health data; • Provide a comprehensive analysis framework for a specific health data set; • Provide a set of modelling tools or algorithms that a health service might use to answer a specific set of questions.”
