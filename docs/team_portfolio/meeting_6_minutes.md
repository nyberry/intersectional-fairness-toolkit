### 2. Metrics Review

The group reviewed the current fairness metric implementations, including group-based and intersectional measures.

Decision:

Kayla will merge her metrics code with Becky’s existing functions to create a unified metrics module.

Raiet will test the visualisation functions and extend the example notebook to include fairness visualisations.

### 4. Documentation and Demo Environment

A Binder-based environment was discussed to allow easy execution of demo notebooks.
