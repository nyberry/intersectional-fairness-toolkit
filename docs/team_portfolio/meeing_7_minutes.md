### 4. Documentation and Demonstration Environment

Documentation (tutorial, API reference, and design decisions) was reviewed and judged to be clear and suitable for assessment.

The Binder environment was discussed to ensure it points to the final released package version rather than a development snapshot.

### 5. Actions Agreed

- Kayla: Lint Jupyter notebooks and add final references
- Becky: Update Binder configuration to point to the final PyPI release
- Nick: Upload version v1.0.0 of the package to PyPI

No further meetings were deemed necessary.
